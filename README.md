> _WARNING_: this repository will soon be archived, as I no longer use qtile or some of these apps, my regular dotfiles will be stored in another repository along with my AwesomeWM dotfiles which I plan to upload soon.

This is my dotfiles repository containing my current qtile config, feel free to take inspiration from it or even use some of my configs.

- **window manager**: qtile
- **terminal**: st
- **text editor**: nvim
- **file manager**: pcmanfm
- **shell**: zsh
- **music player**: cmus

Tsukihime comes with simple, but sensible defaults and features, such as **scratchpads**, **ease of switching out app shortcuts**, **various colorschemes**, **easy to switch keybinds and different visual elements** and another functionalities expected from a tiling window manager.

### TODO
- Add a better, revised list of dependencies
- Make a new installation script (that actually works for everyone)
- Better documentation
